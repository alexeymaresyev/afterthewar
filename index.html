<p style = "font-family: georgia;" ALIGN = center > After the war, Alexey lead a succesful life. He went on to win
many medals, and started training future pilots. His story became popular throughout all of Russia; schoolchildren idolized him,
and he won countless awards. There was a book written about him (named "A Story About a Real Man")which was published over 100 times; 
 there was even an opera created depicting his contributions to the war. 
</p>
<p style = "font-family: georgia;" ALIGN = center > Despite his incredible story, he received minimal praise outside of Russia. If you were
 to google his name, fewer than 5,000 pages would show up. We can't let heroes like this fall into a distant memory, a memory held only by few.
